This is a list of things we absolutely have to iron out before making our site public for the first time.
Just making this because I'm setting up complex shit with half-ass configuration so that I can test and work with it.

1. uuid generation and creation (specifically storage in SupaBase)
    Current uuid process:
        1. User joins site    
            2. If they have a uuid stored in cookies, we load the associated account (right now that has no functionality)
            2. If they don't have a uuid in cookies, we give them one, and add the uuid to USER table in SupaBase
    
    PROBLEM: Someone with a cookie-erasing browser extension on fullauto and spamming refresh could flood SupaBase with infinite rows
        - this potentially costs money or runs us out of free storage for no reason
        - this is also funny and easy to do
    
    SOLUTION: 
        1. We could make a new COLUMN in USERS for last seen i.p.
            - When making the user a new uuid, we check their last seen ip, and if an existing uuid has that last seen ip, we can assign the user their normal uuid
                - This adds a VPN to the workflow of whoever would be abusing our site this way...
        
        2. We could set a maximum for the number of new users we accept a day
            - This is potentially bad like if we go viral (a certainty) and hit that limit organically
            - As long as uuid isn't necessary for normal site function, this is fine
                - Limit uuid system to nonvital functionality like saving user's name and cart

        3. Finally, if someone is spamming uuids like this, we can delete uuids and the associated user data that aren't in use
            - Make DATE LAST SEEN column
                - If DATE CREATED and DATE LAST SEEN are > [time interval] apart, delete the account.
